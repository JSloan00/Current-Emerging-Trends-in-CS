## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The purpose of this project was to create an intelligent agent using the Q-learning algorithm to solve a pathfinding problem. I was provided starter code which contained the matrix for the maze, as well as a visual representation of the maze, the possible movements of the agent, and the functions of the game. I was tasked with creating the Q-learning algorithm for the agent to learn and win the game. 
## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are problem solvers. Software engineers specifically use algorithms and computer languages to create programs to solve these problems. Technology has taken over the world, so without computer scientists, we would be lost. 
### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I will always approach a problem by first learning as much as possible about the issue. Get as many details as possible and then begin planning how to solve the problem. After planning, I will begin implementing a solution and testing the solution along the way. 
### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Ethical responsibilites as a computer scientist ultimately are about protecting users. Creating secure programs that keep private data safe is a top priority, not only for the users, but also the company that the program is made for. Also, being honest and trustworthy is important to have a good reputation and have great teamwork within the workplace.
